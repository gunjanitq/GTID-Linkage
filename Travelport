Travelport Booking Flow & GTID Integration

This repository documents the Travelport Universal API (uAPI) booking process, including
both the session-based workflow and upcoming details on GTID integration.
It serves as a reference for developers and technical teams implementing Travelport services.

ðŸ“‘ Overview

Travelport bookings use a Session Key (Session Token) to maintain state across multiple API requests.
Each request builds on the previous one until a reservation is priced, confirmed, and ticketed.

Future updates will also cover GTID integration, giving developers a complete end-to-end guide.
